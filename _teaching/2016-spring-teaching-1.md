I worked as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Dhaka International University(DIU). The Department of CSE at DIU is a place where not only the brightest young souls from all over the country but also internationals assemble searching for a greater future. I worked as a supportive guide in favor of Foreign Students (such as those from Nepal, Somalia, and Nigeria).
