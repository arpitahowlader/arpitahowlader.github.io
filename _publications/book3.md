The complexity of data requirement increasing day by day; therefore minimization of schema becomes an important role for equi distribution or equalization of two or more problems. Schema complexity is measured by transmitting schema to a graph with weight or weighted graph. Selected special fundamentals from schema for weight the schema graph are described as major part. Minimization of schema ensures easy to measure the schema complexity. Some consideration for this approaches are normalization and de-normalization. We also find the effect of normalization and de-normalization on minimization of schema of real life data model as well as synthetic data model. The purpose of this research is to examine the effectiveness of schema complexity based on schema minimization with weighted graph.
