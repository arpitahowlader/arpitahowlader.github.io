Assistant Professor of the Department of Computer and Communication Engineering (CCE), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU), Bangladesh. My research is in Human-Centric AI with crowdsourcing and crowd sensing with a focus on high-value social domains such as accessibility, and environmental sustainability, and to fuse wireless sensing technology with machine learning to address city-specific challenges and security. I am also passionate about research on digital health technology, data security, and network security.
