Assistant Professor of Department of Computer and Communication Engineering (CCE), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU), Bangladesh. My research is in Human-Centric AI with crowdsourcing and crowd sensing with a focus on high-value social domains such as accessibility, environmental sustainability, and to fuse wireless sensing technology with machine learning to address city-specific challenges and security. I am also passionate about research on digital health technology , data security as well as network security. 

Graduate studies
======
I have completed Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET), in the year of 2020. My Master’s dissertation entitled "Distributed Multi-radio Multi-channel Communication using Directional MAC for IoT-based Wireless Networks", and I was advised by [Dr. Md. Obaidur Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kUqG--oAAAAJ&hl=en). The aim was to find out how to communicate with receiver node without collision by solving some well-known problems like hidden terminal problem, deafness problem, overhearing problem. In this research we detect the location and calculate the distance of IoT devices and also investigate how can use guard band as a negotiation medium.

Earlier I have completed B.Sc degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2015 from Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU). My B.Sc dissertation entitled "Effectiveness of weighted graph of schema to aid the minimization and measurement of schema complexity". During my B.Sc, I was honored to receive a "Dean Merit Fellowship" and Dean Merit award.

Publications and paper
======
Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to learn from and collaborate with top scholars and students, leading to 15+ scientific article publications in premiere venues such as Journal of medical virology, SN comprehensive clinical medicine, PLoS ONE, IJSDR, ICECE. 
dedicated to mapping and assessing every sidewalk in the world using Human+AI techniques.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.



For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
