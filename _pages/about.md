Assistant Professor of the Department of Computer and Communication Engineering (CCE), Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU), Bangladesh. My research is in Human-Centric AI with crowdsourcing and crowd sensing with a focus on high-value social domains such as accessibility, and environmental sustainability, and to fuse wireless sensing technology with machine learning to address city-specific challenges and security. I am also passionate about research on digital health technology, data security, and network security. 

Graduate studies
======
I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET) in 2020. My Master’s dissertation entitled "Distributed Multi-radio Multi-channel Communication using Directional MAC for IoT-based Wireless Networks", and [Dr. Md. Obaidur Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kUqG--oAAAAJ&hl=en) advised me. The aim was to find out how to communicate with the receiver node without collision by solving some well-known problems like hidden terminal problems, deafness problems, and overhearing problems. In this research, we detect the location and calculate the distance of IoT devices and also investigate how can use a guard band as a negotiation medium.

Earlier I completed a B.Sc degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2015 from Patuakhali Science and Technology University (PSTU). My B.Sc dissertation entitled "Effectiveness of weighted graph of schema to aid the minimization and measurement of schema complexity". During my B.Sc, I was honored to receive a "Dean Merit Fellowship" and Dean Merit Award.

Publications and paper
======
Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to learn from and collaborate with top scholars and students, leading to 15+ scientific article publications in premiere venues such as the Journal of Medical Virology, SN Comprehensive Clinical Medicine, PLoS ONE, IJSDR, ICECE. Through our research work, we are dedicated to mapping and assessing every sidewalk in the world using Human+AI techniques.
